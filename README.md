# typing-practice

## Setup

Put the characters you want to be tested on in `characters.txt`, one character per line.

See `characters.txt.example` for an example.

## Usage

```
$ ruby typing-practice.rb
```

Quit by typing any non-included character (Ctrl+C will do).

Your progress is saved in `progress.txt` as you go, so come and go as you please!
